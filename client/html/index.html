    <p>Bio:


In today’s rapidly evolving cyber landscape, [Project Name] is designed to help penetration testers and bug hunters save time and effort by automating the web crawling and vulnerability scanning process. By combining intelligent reconnaissance with advanced security testing, it enables security professionals to analyze web applications, detect vulnerabilities, and generate detailed security reports effortlessly.

🌐 Advanced Web Crawling & Mapping
Our powerful web crawler systematically explores websites, analyzing their structure and identifying potential security risks. It:
✔ Navigates through links, forms, and dynamic content to map the entire application.
✔ Identifies hidden endpoints and sensitive files that could expose security weaknesses.
✔ Detects misconfigurations and potential attack surfaces for further analysis.
<br>
<br>
🔍 Automated Vulnerability Scanning
Once the web crawling phase is complete, Speedy conducts a fully automated security scan, identifying vulnerabilities with zero manual effort, including:
✔ Local File Inclusion (LFI): Detects improper file handling vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access.
✔ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Identifies script injection flaws that could compromise user data.
✔ Open Redirects: Uncovers unvalidated redirections that could be exploited for phishing attacks.
<br>
<br>
📊 Instant Security Reports
After each scan, Speedy generates a detailed security report, allowing pentesters and bug hunters to quickly analyze and act on findings. Reports include:
✔ A full overview of discovered vulnerabilities, categorized by risk level.
✔ A visualized site map generated from the crawling process.
✔ Technical exploitation scenarios & mitigation recommendations.
✔ Comprehensive scan logs for further analysis and verification.
<br>
<br>
⚡ How It Works:
1️⃣ Enter a target domain – The crawler maps the entire website structure.
2️⃣ Perform an in-depth security scan – Identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities automatically.
3️⃣ Download a professionally formatted report – With technical insights and security recommendations.
<br>
<br>
💡 Why Choose Speedy?
✅ Saves Time & Effort – Designed for pentesters & bug hunters who need quick results.
✅ Automated Crawling & Scanning – No manual intervention required.
✅ Comprehensive Security Reports – Instant, structured, and actionable findings.

🔒 Spend less time on repetitive tasks and focus on what really matters – securing applications.
